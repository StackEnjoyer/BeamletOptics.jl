    ObjectGroup <: AbstractObjectGroup

A tree-like storage container for groups of objects. Can store individual objects and subgroups.
Main purpose is handling of, i.e., groups of lenses.

## Fields

- `center`: a point in 3D space which is regarded as the reference origin of the group
- `dir`: a 3x3 matrix that describes the common `orientation` of the group
- `objects`: stores [`AbstractObject`](@ref), can also store subgroups of type [`AbstractObjectGroup`](@ref)

## Kinematic

A `ObjectGroup` implements the kinematic functions of [`AbstractObject`](@ref). The following logic is applied to

- [`translate3d!`](@ref): all objects in the group are translated by the offset vector
- [`translate_to3d!`](@ref): all objects are moved in parallel such that the group `center` is equal to the target position
- [`rotate3d!`](@ref): all objects are rotated around the `center` point with respect to their relative position
