    AbstractShape{T<:Real}

A generic type for a shape that exists in 3D-space. Must have a `pos`ition and orientation.\\
Types used to describe the geometry of a shape should be subtypes of `Real`.\\

# Implementation reqs.

Subtypes of `AbstractShape` should implement the following:

## Fields:

- `pos`: a 3D-vector that stores the current `position` of the object-specific coordinate system
- `dir`: a 3x3-matrix that represents the orthonormal basis of the object and therefore, the `orientation`

## Getters/setters

- [`position`](@ref) / `position!`: gets or sets the `pos`ition vector of the `AbstractShape`
- [`orientation`](@ref) / `orientation!`: gets or sets the orientation matrix of the `AbstractShape`

## Kinematic:

- [`translate3d!`](@ref): the object is moved by a translation vector relative to its current position
- [`translate_to3d!`](@ref): the object is moved towards the target position
- [`rotate3d!`](@ref): the object is rotated by an angle around a reference vector
- [`xrotate3d!`](@ref): rotation around the x-axis
- [`yrotate3d!`](@ref): rotation around the y-axis
- [`zrotate3d!`](@ref): rotation around the z-axis
- [`align3d!`](@ref): align local shape y-axis with target vector
- [`reset_translation3d!`](@ref): return the `object` to the global origin
- [`reset_rotation3d!`](@ref): rotate the `object` back into its original state

## Ray Tracing:

- [`intersect3d`](@ref): returns the intersection between an `AbstractShape` and `AbstractRay`, or lack thereof. See also [`Intersection`](@ref)

## Rendering (with Makie):

Refer to the [`render!`](@ref) documentation.
