    AbstractRay{T<:Real}

An implementation for a geometrical optics ray in R³. In general, a `AbstractRay` is described by ``\\vec{p} + t\\cdot\\vec{d}`` with ``t\\in(0,\\infty)``.
`AbstractRay`s are intended to model the propagation of light between optical interactions according to the laws of geometrical optics.
To store the result of a ray tracing solution, refer to [`AbstractBeam`](@ref).

# Intersections:

Since the length of a ray can not be known before solving an optical system, the [`Intersection`](@ref)-type is used.
This [`Nullable`](@ref) type can represent the intersection with an optical element, or lack thereof.

# Implementation reqs.

Subtypes of `AbstractBeam` must implement the following:

## Fields:

- `pos`: a R³-vector that stores the current position ``\\vec{p}``
- `dir`: a R³-vector that stores the current direction ``\\vec{d}``
- `intersection`: a `Nullable` field that stores the current [`Intersection`] or `nothing`
- `λ`: wavelength in [m]
- `n`: refractive index along the ray path

# Additional information

!!! info "Ray length"
    Base.`length`: this function is used to return the length of the `AbstractRay` (if no intersection exists, the ray length is `Inf`).
    The `opl` keyword can be used to obtain the optical path length instead.

!!! warning "Ray direction"
    Many functions assume that the `dir`ection vector has unit length (i.e. ``|\\vec{p}| = 1``).
    Violating this assumption might lead to spurious results.
