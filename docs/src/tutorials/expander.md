# Beam expander

This section will help you to run your first simulation using this package. We will start by modeling a simple [Keplerian beam expander](https://www.thorlabs.us/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=14648). You will learn how to:

1. Define a simple [`SphericalLens`](@ref) and spawn a [`Beam`](@ref)
2. Rotate and translate objects
3. Visualize the optical arrangement 
4. Solve an optical system using geometrical optics

For this tutorial, we will use two thin spherical lenses to magnify a collimated beam. 

### Defining the lenses

We start by defining two lenses and calculating their analytical focal lengths `f1` and `f2`, which will be required later. The focal length of an ideal thin lens ([`BeamletOptics.lensmakers_eq`](@ref)) can be calculated via

```math
\frac{1}{f} \approx (n_L - 1) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right)
```

where ``n_L`` is the lens refractive index and ``R_{1/2}`` are the radii of curvature of the front and back spherical surface. In addition, the magnificant of a two lens system can be determined by ``M = f_2/f_1``.

```@example beam_expander
using CairoMakie, BeamletOptics

# Lens 1
R11 = 20e-3
R12 = 60e-3
nl1 = 1.5
d1 = BeamletOptics.inch
f1 = BeamletOptics.lensmakers_eq(R11, -R12, nl1)
l1 = SphericalLens(R11, R12, 0, d1, λ->nl1)

# Lens 2
R21 = 60e-3
R22 = 90e-3
nl2 = 1.5
d2 = 2*BeamletOptics.inch
f2 = BeamletOptics.lensmakers_eq(R21, -R22, nl2)
l2 = SphericalLens(R21, R22, 0, d2, λ->nl1)

M = f2/f1

@info "f1, f2, M" f1 f2 M
```

where `nl` is the lens refractive index required for the lensmakers equation. Note that the lens cylinder section thickness is set to zero and that the first lens has a diameter of one inch, whereas the second lens has a diameter of two inches.

!!! info
    Unless specified otherwise, this package assumes SI-units for input parameters.
     - i.e. `R11 = 20e-3` corresponds to a radius of curvature of 20 mm.
     - `nl1 = 1.5` corresponds to a unitless refractive index

Further, we have specified constant refractive indices `nl1` and `nl2`. Therefore, it will not matter which wavelength we chose for the ray/beam later on, since ``n_L(\lambda) = 1.5``. In general, however, a function  ``n(\lambda)`` can be passed that models dispersion for different wavelengths, or a [`DiscreteRefractiveIndex`](@ref).

### Setting up the system and moving elements

We then define that our optical system consists of the lens elements `l1` and `l2` and move the elements into position using the following translation and rotation commands:

```@example beam_expander
# define system and move elements
system = System([l1, l2])

zrotate3d!(l1, deg2rad(180))
zrotate3d!(l2, deg2rad(180))

translate3d!(l2, [0, f1+f2, 0])
```

Note that the second lens has been moved by the combined focal length `f1+f2` along the y-axis. To visualize what we have done so far, we will use the plotting helper functions that are based on the [Makie](https://docs.makie.org/stable/) package.

```@example beam_expander
# Plot
fig = Figure(size=(600,240))
aspect = (1,4,1)
limits = (-0.025, 0.025, -0.05, 0.15, -0.025, 0.025)
ax = Axis3(fig[1,1], aspect=aspect, limits=limits, azimuth=0., elevation=1e-3)
hidedecorations!(ax)

render!(ax, system)

save("expander_no_beams.png", fig, px_per_unit=4); nothing # hide
```

![Beam Expander](expander_no_beams.png)

We can see that both lenses have been placed along the (optical) y-axis.   

!!! tip "3D viewing"
    In practice it is recommend to replace `Axis3` with a `LScene` and use `GLMakie` for a better viewing experience, i.e. `ax = LScene(fig[1,1])`.

### Propagating beams through the system

We will now define a single beam that propagates through our optical system. First, we start by defining a [`Ray`](@ref) with a starting position and direction that is used to generate a [`Beam`](@ref). This beam can then be propagated through the expander using the [`solve_system!`](@ref) function:

```@example beam_expander
# Propagate a single ray through the system
start_pos = [0, -0.15, 4e-3]
start_dir = [0, 1., 0]

ray = Ray(start_pos, start_dir)

beam = Beam(ray)

solve_system!(system, beam)

render!(ax, beam, show_pos=true)

save("expander_one_beam.png", fig, px_per_unit=4); nothing # hide
```

Rendering the `beam` into the 3D-`ax`is defined above will allow us to see the result:

![Beam Expander](expander_one_beam.png)

If we perform this step for different z-values of the ray starting position, we can obtain a collimated ray bundle and look at the magnification of the beam expander:

```@example beam_expander
# Propagate multiple rays through the system
zs = -4e-3:2e-3:4e-3
for z in zs
    b = Beam(Ray([0, -0.15, z], [0, 1., 0]))
    solve_system!(system, b)
    render!(ax, b)
end

save("expander_all_beams.png", fig, px_per_unit=4); nothing # hide
```

![Beam Expander](expander_all_beams.png)

Let us also propagate some rays through the outer region of the magnifier. We will color them red.

```@example beam_expander
# Propagate rays through edge region
zs = 6e-3:2e-3:8e-3
for z in cat(-zs, zs; dims=1)
    b = Beam(Ray([0, -0.15, z], [0, 1., 0]))
    solve_system!(system, b)
    render!(ax, b, color=:red)
end

save("expander_abberations.png", fig, px_per_unit=4); nothing # hide
```

![Beam Expander](expander_abberations.png)

It can be observed that these beams are not collimated after the magnifier, but rather focused. This is due to the effect of spherical abberations.
